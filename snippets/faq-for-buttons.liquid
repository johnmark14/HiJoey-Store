    How will I teach my pup to touch the button?
  </h4>
</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    There are many successful ways that people have taught their dogs to use the
    buttons. The most common way to teach your pup is through a combination of
    Modeling and Targeting techniques. But just like people, all doggos have
    different learning styles and strengths. Make sure to checkout our Training
    section to learn more.

  <h4 class="h4-strong h4-small">Where should I place the buttons?</h4>
</label>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
    The most common option is putting your first button in a place that makes the most sense
    for intended action/word. For example, if the button is for going "Outside" or "Walk",
    it would be easier for your pup to learn and associate the button if it was placed beside
    the door that you frequently use to take them out for a walk.</p>
  <p>
    However, it's important to note that once your pup learns multiple communication buttons
    and tries to combine words together, the separated button locations may make them run
    back and forth between each button. When your pup gets to this level, keeping all the 
    buttons in one easily accessible single location is preferred. Make sure to checkout our
    hijoey Mats to learn more.</p>
